##Weather and map project using react redux with charts and Googlemaps

#I created an app that displays the weather information for the city you search for in charts and shows the location on Google Maps. 

#I used React, Redux to manage state, Bootstrap, the openweathermap and Google maps APIs, as well as Sparklines to display the charts for  the 5 day weather forecast for temperature, pressure and humidity.

#To run the app clone the repository then navigate to the path where it is saved using the console/terminal and type npm install and press enter then type npm start and press enter.

#Then open your browser and enter the URL "http://localhost:8080/" in the address bar.
