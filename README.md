weather_and_map_project_using_react_redux_with_charts_and_Googlemaps

#I created an app That displays the weather information for the city you search for in charts and shows the location on Google Maps. 

#I used React, Redux to manage state Bootstrap, the openweathermap and Google maps APIs as well as Sparklines to display the charts of weather information.

#To run the app clone the repository then navigate to the path where it is saved using the console/terminal and type npm install and press enter then type npm start and press enter.

#Then open your browser and enter the URL "http://localhost:8080/" in the address bar.
